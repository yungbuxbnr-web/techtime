# Monthly Absence Reset - User Guide

## What Is It?

The app now automatically resets your absence records at the beginning of each new month. This means you start fresh every month without having to manually clear your absence hours.

## How It Works

### Automatic Reset

When you open the app on the first day of a new month (or any day in a new month if you haven't opened it yet), the app will:

1. Detect that a new month has started
2. Automatically reset your absence hours to 0
3. Show you a friendly notification confirming the reset

### What You'll See

When the reset happens, you'll see a notification like this:

```
🗓️ New month detected!

Absence records have been automatically reset for March 2025.

Previous month: February 2025
```

This lets you know that:
- Your absence hours have been reset for the new month
- The previous month's data has been cleared
- You can start logging absence for the new month

## Using the Absence Logger

   - **Deduction Type** (Monthly Target or Available Hours)
4. Review the calculation preview
5. Tap **✅ Log Absence & Update Hours**

## Examples

### Example 1: Vacation Days

You're taking 3 full days off for vacation:

1. Open Settings → Absence Logger
2. Select: 3 days, Full Day, Monthly Target Hours
3. Preview shows: 3 days × 8.5 hours = 25.5 hours deducted
4. Confirm the absence
5. Your monthly target is reduced by 25.5 hours

### Example 2: Sick Day

You're sick for 1 full day:

1. Open Settings → Absence Logger
2. Select: 1 day, Full Day, Total Available Hours
3. Preview shows: 1 day × 8.5 hours = 8.5 hours deducted
4. Confirm the absence
5. Your efficiency calculation accounts for the sick day

### Example 3: Half Day Appointment

You have a doctor's appointment (half day):

1. Open Settings → Absence Logger
2. Select: 1 day, Half Day, Total Available Hours
3. Preview shows: 1 day × 4.25 hours = 4.25 hours deducted
4. Confirm the absence
5. Your efficiency reflects the half day off

## Monthly Reset Behavior

### What Happens Each Month

**Last Day of Month:**
- Your absence hours are still tracked
- All calculations include your logged absences

**First Day of New Month:**
- When you open the app, absence hours reset to 0
- You see a notification confirming the reset
- You can immediately start logging absence for the new month

### What Doesn't Reset

The monthly reset only affects absence hours. These remain unchanged:
- Your job records
- Your monthly target hours setting
- Your PIN and security settings
- Your theme preference
- All other app settings

## Viewing Your Absence Impact

### Dashboard

The Dashboard shows how absence affects your metrics:

**Monthly Target Circle**
- Shows progress toward your target hours
- If you deducted absence from monthly target, the target is lower

**Efficiency Circle**
- Shows your efficiency percentage
- If you deducted absence from available hours, efficiency is calculated accordingly

**Monthly Breakdown Card**
- Shows total available hours (includes absence deductions)
- Shows efficiency percentage

### Settings

In Settings, you can see:
- Current month's total absence hours
- Calculation preview before logging absence
- Impact on monthly target or available hours

## Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Log Absence Promptly**: Log your absence as soon as you know about it
2. **Check Preview**: Always review the calculation preview before confirming
3. **Choose Correct Type**: Use Monthly Target for planned time off, Available Hours for unexpected absences
4. **Monthly Review**: At the end of each month, review your absence impact on efficiency

### Common Questions

**Q: What if I forget to log absence?**
A: You can log absence at any time during the month. The calculations will update immediately.

**Q: Can I see previous months' absence?**
A: Currently, only the current month's absence is tracked. Previous months' data is not stored.

**Q: What if I log absence by mistake?**
A: There's no undo button, but you can adjust your monthly target hours manually in Settings to compensate.

**Q: Does absence affect my job records?**
A: No, absence only affects your target hours and efficiency calculations. Your job records remain unchanged.

**Q: What happens if I don't open the app for a whole month?**
A: When you next open the app, it will detect the new month and reset automatically, regardless of how much time has passed.

## Troubleshooting

### Absence Hours Not Resetting

1. Make sure your device date is correct
2. Close and reopen the app

### Notification Not Appearing

The reset notification only appears on the Dashboard screen. If you don't see it:

If efficiency or target calculations seem wrong:

1. Check Settings → Absence Logger
2. Verify your current month's absence hours
3. Ensure you're using the correct deduction type
4. Review the calculation preview before logging
